# Computer Vision Studies

This repository contains both code and explanations of Computer Vision topics and books I've studied. Everything I've found most useful is compiled here.

## Directories

### Books

Code related to books I've read. At the moment, containing a few useful snippets from ModernCV with Pytorch from Packt.

### Codes

Codes I've implemented either by myself or through Youtube lessons. I've found that coding, even just writing code along with Youtube lessons, helped me a lot to internalize concepts and get more confortable with Pytorch.
