# Computer Vision Studies

This repository contains both code and explanations of Computer Vision topics and books I've studied. Everything I've found most useful is compiled here.

## Directories

### Books

Code related to books I've read. At the moment, containing a few useful snippets from ModernCV with Pytorch from Packt.

### Autoencoders

Some encoders I've implemented for personal experiments which worked very well while still not being super deep.

### GANs

Some GAN codes from [Aladdin Persson](https://www.youtube.com/c/AladdinPersson)'s channel. Phenomenal videos.
