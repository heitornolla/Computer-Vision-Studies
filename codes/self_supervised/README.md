# Self Supervised Deep Learning

These codes are adaptations from Janani Ravi's LinkedIn Learning course. It is a phenomenal course and I can't recommend it enough.

In short of two hours, she covers what is Self Supervised Learning, contrastive and non-contrastive techniques and pretext tasks. In the rest of the course, she describes the methods implemented -- a baseline ResNet50 classifier, SimCLR and SwAV -- and explains the implementation details and PyTorch Lightning code.

It was also my very first time programming with PyTorch Lightning and the transition couldn't have been smoother. Great material.
