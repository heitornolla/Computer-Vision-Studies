# Why should I learn Go?

Well, I'm not sure if you should, but its quite fun and a good skill to have.

I initially got into Go because I thought the mascot looked really dumb, and it made me want to learn it.
It turned out to be a pretty fun language, and really useful for fast model deployment.

The website [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list) is a very fun and light-hearted intro to the language and I 100% recommend it. Other resources will be listed soon.

I'm using Go 1.25.4 for these codes.
