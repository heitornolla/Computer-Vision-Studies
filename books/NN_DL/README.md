# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I don't even remember how I came into contact with this book, but it is phenomenal for anyone who knows about NNs but has no idea how CV works.

The book offers very intuitive explanations, great analogies, very clear theory and good exercises. Not much else to say, very worth the read.
