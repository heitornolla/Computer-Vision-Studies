# Which books should I read?

Short answer: all of them. 

I've definetly noticed that the way in which I learn better is through exposure. Seeing, reading and coding the same concepts multiple times helps me really understand a concept more deeply.

Other than that, different people will have different ways of explaining the same concept, and you may benefit from multiple explanations of something, even if you feel like you know them deeply.

Overall, I do feel like all of these books are well-worth your time. Some are more technical, others are very light reads, but all of them contributed to my learning in a way.
