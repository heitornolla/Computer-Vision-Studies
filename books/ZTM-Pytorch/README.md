# Zero to Mastery's Pytorch Book

I've found this book to be quite a useful complementary resource to other materials which I've been studying.

While the book does not cover in-depth theory, I was frequently surprised to see a few things which no other books cover, mainly in the [Going Modular](https://www.learnpytorch.io/05_pytorch_going_modular/), [Experiment Tracking](https://www.learnpytorch.io/07_pytorch_experiment_tracking/) and [Paper Replicating](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/) chapters. Homeworks where also very well structured and useful.

Of course, I don't believe any one single book can bring you from Zero to Mastery, but going through this one is very worthwhile. ZTM offers a quick read and a lot of useful content.
