# Fast.AI's Deep Learning for Coders

FastAI takes a code-first approach to deep learning, which for me was very exciting and very different from other learning resources.

I definitely felt a bit uncomfortable in the first few chapters, mostly because I didnâ€™t fully understand what I was doing yet. But now, I see that it was a part of the learning process and helped me build intuition over time.

I highly recommend taking the FastAI course and reading the accompanying book (which is free online). Still, I'm sure that I got much more out of it from already having foundational Deep Learning knowledge from other sources.
