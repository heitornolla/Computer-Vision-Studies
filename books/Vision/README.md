# Vision by David Marr

I came across this book from a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohfeAXsk9Co) by Halisson Paz, and I'm glad I did.

This book is unlike anything else I've read CV-related. It covers philosophical aspects of vision and image representation, which I did not see anywhere else yet, and made me a better developer.

Vision is a very rewarding read, much lighter than other more technical books and I recommend it to every one.
