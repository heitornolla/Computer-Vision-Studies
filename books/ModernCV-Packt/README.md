# Modern CV with Pytorch

This was the first CV book I ever read and, if not for having taken MOOCs, I'd be really lost.

The book starts of fine, but as you get to further chapters (11 and beyond IMO) it really starts to just spit out code with little to know theory/intuition talk.

The book was phenomenal for getting me confortable with Pytorch, and I definetly recommend coding along with it to get some experience. But if you're familiar with the library and want purely a good theory book, this is not it.
