# Useful Lessons

In these sections, I list MOOCs, Youtube lessons, articles and other resources which have helped me in different ways.

## MOOCs

MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are an essential learning resource in my opinion. The amount of knowledge you can gain from watching a few 1h-long lessons is extremely valuable. Still, **don't get stuck on MOOCs**. A mistake I made early on was watching a lot of MOOCs thinking I was learning "more", when I was actually just procrastinating and staying stuck at the same level.

I do recommend watching them, but keep in mind trying to develop personal projects or research interests, if thats what you're into.

### Stanford's Machine Learning Course

I personally feel like an understanding of ML is essential before diving into Deep Learning. This course is phenomenal, and a few concepts which are useful for Deep Learning (e.g. gradient descent) much more thoroughly in this course.

See it [here](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)

### Stanford's Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This was the first Deep Learning MOOC I ever saw, and I couldn't recommend it more. I feel like both versions of the course are well worth going into from the time I'm writing this. Computer Vision has changed, but Transformer-based models are not (at least as of right now) a full-on replacement for CNNs, so it is worth it to check out the earlier and newer lectures.

See it [here](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

### VizuaraAI's Computer Vision Series

I'm not sure if Vizuara's CV course can be considered a MOOC per se, but I certainly gained a lot of value from it. Even though it starts from as basic of a level as possible, I believe going through CS231 first (or having previous knowledge in the area) before following it is the better experience.

This course was the best I've ever seen in CV. I can't recommend it enough. All of Vizuara's courses are phenomenal and if you're interested in Deep Learning, you should definetly check out their content.

### Image Processing

Image Processing is ofter left-out from Computer Vision MOOCs, but I feel like it is the sort of thing you should know if you want to have a more profound knowledge of CV. I personally went through [IMPA's Image Processing course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4jXE-LdDTRaFa39TdNN3FgPAKkcuHvj), phenomenal for portuguese speaker, but I can't recomend any IP MOOCs in English

## Youtube Lessons / Content Creators

### Aladdin Persson

Started following him for his GANs course, but I recommend pretty much every video on his channel. His Pytorch Lightning series is also great.

### ExplainingAI

The name says it all. Great lessons, visual explanations and code-along videos.

### Yannic Kilcher

An invaluable content creator aswell. Started following from his videos explaining Machine Learning papers and I can deeply recommend his content.

### DeepFindr

DeepFindr has the best dimensionality reduction content I've ever seen. Great animations and phenomenal content.

## Loose/Separate Content

Couldn't find a category for these, but they're still very useful:

## Books

See the `/books` directory.
